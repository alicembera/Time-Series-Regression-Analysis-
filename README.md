# Regression-Project-on-Coorporation-Favorita
Corporation Favorita aims to optimize its inventory management by accurately forecasting the demand for various products across its stores in Ecuador. The goal is to ensure that each store has the right quantity of products in stock to meet customer demand while minimizing overstocking or stockouts.

# Introduction
Corporation Favorita wants to ensure that they always have the right quantity of products in stock. To do this I have decided to build a series of machine learning models to forecast the demand of products in various locations. The marketing and sales team have provided you with some data to aid this endeavor. CRISP-DM Framework for Data Science projects were used.

## Insights from data analysis
The dataset provided were train, test, stores, oil, transaction, sample_submission and holiday_events. However, the main dataset useeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

## Hypothesis and Questions
The following hypothesis was stated for the regression analysis:
Null Hypothesis (Ho): Holidays do not have a significant effect on the sales 

Alternate Hypothesis (Ha): Holidays have a significant effect on the sales

## Questions
1. Is the train dataset complete (has all the required dates)?
2. Which dates have the lowest and highest sales for each year (excluding days the store was closed)?
3. Compare the sales for each month across the years and determine which month of which year had the highest sales.
4. Did the earthquake impact sales?
5. Are certain stores or groups of stores selling more products? (Cluster, city, state, type)
6. Are sales affected by promotions, oil prices and holidays?
7. What analysis can we get from the date and its extractable features?
8. Which product family and stores did the promotions affect.
9. What is the difference between RMSLE, RMSE, MSE (or why is the MAE greater than all of them?)
10. Does the payment of wages in the public sector on the 15th and last days of the month influence the store sales.
